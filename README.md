# PlanckII MCMC
A project utilizing MCMC to constrain the basic cosmological parameters of the universe using the Planck Public Data Release II data. Code is provided in ProjectNotebook.ipynb. The PDF writeup is "Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Planck Public Data Release II". Note that I have purposefully ommited many of the data sets that I generated since they became quite large.
